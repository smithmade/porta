   <p class="question">Fredrica. That’s an unusual name. Any history behind it?</p>
   <p class="answer">Yeah, my mother went to school with a girl who had that name and she liked it. She actually ran into her for the first time, since the third grade! She told her that she named me after her and as they got to talking, it turned out she (Fredrica) had been to Porta last summer when we opened, and she loved it. I’m sure I’ll get to meet her sometime soon. Anyway, I am so grateful to my mom for giving me that name. It has really given me something to live into: I feel like it has defined me. I wouldn’t be who I am if I were a Sally or a Candy. She almost named me Gabriella, though. That would have been tragic. No offense to any Gabriellas out there.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">So what’s a creative director at a branding firm doing making Neapolitan pizzas?</p>
   <p class="answer">Well, Meg, the founder of Knockout, said, “We are going to open a Neapolitan pizza
restaurant,” and I said emphatically, “I want to make the pizza.” It was something
that called to me from deep inside: it just felt right. I was 100% clear that I was
going to do this. Nothing was going to stop me. Cooking is design, really. Design is
everything; everything is design. Pizza is design. Making pizza is another part of
being a creative director.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">What was it like learning from Roberto (Caporuscio)?</p>
   <p class="answer">Wow, how do I answer that? Walking in the first day and seeing him standing by
the oven, the smell of wood burning, the crisp March air following me, the smell
of espresso. It all started… it left a huge impression on me. It changed my life. You
can’t help but fall in love with him. I’ll tell you more about that over a glass of wine
sometime. He is kind and patient, but his commitment to his craft and integrity
IS his purpose and you can’t help but to take that on yourself. He lives outside of
himself: his commitment is beyond his physical body. Great leaders don’t let things
get in the way of their vision. I learned way more from him than how to make
Neapolitan pizza. That part came easy.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">And what’s it like teaching the art of pizza making to your team?</p>
   <p class="answer">Challenging! The training started while Porta was under construction. As soon as the ovens arrived from Italy, we started with a makeshift workstation. I was running all the dishes to the Brickwall. It was hot and dusty and loud. It was one of the best times of my life, though. Not everyone gets it. Some are really natural at it. We have a great team: they’re constantly training. Roberto told me the most important thing is to be open. He said he learns new things all the time, even after being a master for 12 years.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">I feel like teaching someone how to roll dough is like teaching someone to ride
a bike. Any truth in that or am I just making stuff up?</p>
   <p class="answer">Totally. It’s frustrating and awkward at first. Then it just happens after awhile: you
just grab the dough and ball it up with out thinking about it. And there you are,
dough balling like a champ.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">You have a pretty unique sense of style. It’s rather charming to witness. How
does something like that develop?</p>
   <p class="answer">Wow, thanks. For me what I wear is a reflection of how I feel and what’s going on for
me in my life at that moment. I’ve gone from feeling completely not self-expressed
and dressing like a librarian to where I am right now, dressing up for making pizza,
vintage skirts and aprons, wearing rollers, loving color. Again, it’s all related to
design, like making pizza: we get up and we have an idea of what our personal brand
is and we dress to that. We design ourselves.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">Speaking of charm, do you think it’s something that people naturally have? Or
is it a talent in itself?</p>
   <p class="answer">Oh, Christ! I think it’s both. I think people are born with it and some people have to
work at it. There’s a line between what’s natural and trying too hard. It probably
comes with age.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">Porta seems very authentic. Do you think authenticity is a fad? That’s such a
paradoxical statement.</p>
   <p class="answer">OK, we are getting deep here. No way! Authenticity for me is honesty and openness,
coming from the heart and a real place. Everything we do comes from there. No
bullshit.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">Do you think people really care about authentic experiences? Can people even
have an authentic experience in this day and age?</p>
   <p class="answer">Good question. People do care about it. You can go to a chain and have people
clapping and singing in your face, and you want to run screaming and never go back.
Or you can come see us and meet everyone on a real level and have a place that feels
like a real second home, like it is for me. We are all committed to giving everything
we have with all of our heart. That’s authentic. We have genuine love for each other
and the place and what we do and that’s contagious.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">How’s your Volvo driving these days?</p>
   <p class="answer">Great (thanks to Meg)! 10 years and counting! I LOVE my car. It feels like home.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">I hear you like to drive fast. Want to race?</p>
   <p class="answer">Absolutely! Although your car looks pretty fast…</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">Fast cars and loose men. Your thoughts.</p>
   <p class="answer">Yes and yes. Together, absolute trouble, but I love it! I love to live my life fast and
have<br /> amazing experiences.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">Do you believe in soul mates? Or souls in general? They sound so cliché, but
maybe that’s the point.</p>
   <p class="answer">I’ve lost my belief in soul mates. I do think I’m the romantic type and I would like to find someone I can say is
something like my soul mate. I’ll let you know when that happens. As far as souls go,
yes, I think we can exist beyond ourselves.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">Do you feel like there’s a purpose to all of this? Do you have to work to create
that purpose?</p>
   <p class="answer">Oh wow, another deep question. I believe you create your purpose. That’s why I’m
at Knockout and Porta: I wouldn’t be anywhere else in the world. Being with all of
them — Jason, Meg, Kyle, Jimmy, Mark — gives me something to live into, something
to get excited about everyday, knowing that we are all in it together makes it all
worth it.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">Are cats here to make us laugh?</p>
   <p class="answer">Yes! That’s why there are so many YouTube videos of cats out there. Cats are very
intelligent: they know what’s going on.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">Could you sing the Candice Bergen song one more time?</p>
   <p class="answer">Look at that Candice Bergen / Look at that Candice Bergen / Look at that Candice
Bergen / She is so sassy / Look at that Candice Bergen / Look at that Candice Bergen
/ Look at that Candice Bergen / She is so meowy / She is so sassy / Look at how
sassy she is / She’s making meowies / Making meowies is her biz<br /><br />Then just repeat that from the beginning.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">Do you have any other songs you’d like to share?</p>
   <p class="answer">I’ll have to quote one from my mother here. She is an absolute nut! I love her and all
of her self-expression. She’s always making up songs and driving my dad crazy. “Go
rain check, go rain check, go rain check.”</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">Razor Blazers. Tea Buddies. Slaughter Trailer. Which one is a real band?</p>
   <p class="answer">Razor Blazers. Tea Buddies and Slaughter Trailer are concept bands, for now. We’ll
see what happens. Stay tuned.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">That was too easy of a question.</p>
   <p class="answer">Yeah.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">The more I think about it, the more I feel like you’re just one, long, crazy,
fun, weird song wrapped up into a woman. What would your EP be titled?</p>
   <p class="answer">Meowzaroni.</p>   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>
<p class="question">We should totally get into the recording studio right now. What instrument
are you going to play?</p>
   <p class="answer">The brown Casio. And what are you going to play?</p>  
   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div> 
   <p class="question">Kazoo</p>
   <p class="answer">Awesome.</p>
