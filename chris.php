   <p class="question">In your Instagram profile, you write your name as Killabreeze, followed by two emojis of a gun pointing at an octopus. 
    I feel like we&#8217;re entering Freudian territory, but is there any story behind this? There&#8217;s a dark comedy to it that tickles me.</p>
   
   <p class="answer">It’s a nickname a buddy of mine called me once. Like Calabreeze. Nobody calls me that. I think it’s fun and I like to shoot octopus.</p>


   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

<p class="question">What are your thoughts on Instagram specifically, and social media in general? Are we all becoming slaves to the documentation 
  of our lives? I sometimes feel like people taking photos of their food are losing a part of the dining experience. Or maybe I&#8217;m just thinking 
  too seriously about this.
</p>

   <p class="answer">No, you might be right. I don&#8217;t know. Nothing like being out with friends and everyone is updating, hash-tagging, and commenting 
    on something.  Personally I enjoy the glimpse into someone&#8217;s day, and I could stare at food pics for hours and get hungry. You eat first with your 
    eyes. So when friends tell me my insta account made them hungry, I take it as a huge compliment.</p>   

<div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

<p class="question">Do you think the role of an executive chef includes having a social presence? Or should they be more of an unseen genius?
</p>

   <p class="answer">Genius? I think I&#8217;m more comfortable unseen, behind the curtain. When I did my first dinner party for Porta, I felt that I was 
    bothering people by talking about the meals and I believe now that people want that presence and it even may enhance the meal. Thinking back, if 
    I was at a restaurant, I got star-struck when I&#8217;d eat a good meal and see the chef walking around later, but I&#8217;m probably just weird. 
</p>   

<div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

<p class="question">It&#8217;s been famously written that genius is 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration. How would you breakdown genius?</p>

   <p class="answer">That&#8217;s a good quote by Thomas Edison. I like, &#8220;Things may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle.&#8221;
    Abe Lincoln said that. These guys had some great lines. Hard work is how you get anywhere, it got me here.  
</p>

<div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

   <p class="question">Let&#8217;s keep talking about numbers. Is the metric system really the superior system? Why can&#8217;t Americans just get on board?
</p>
   <p class="answer">Yes, I guess it&#8217;s superior? I use it, but I do not know enough about it. I can't remember learning it growing up but recipes 
    from around the world have forced me to use liters.
</p>   

<div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

<p class="question">You drive a BMW Z4 with a radio that doesn't work. What does that silence sound like?
</p>

   <p class="answer">Your fact finders are good, but it&#8217;s a 2000 BMW Z3. 
</p>   

<div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

<p class="question">You&#8217;re originally from Brooklyn. Do you ever drive your BMW into the city to watch the Nets play?
</p>

   <p class="answer">Sounds like fun but no.</p>   

   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

<p class="question">Favorite sport. Go. </p>

<p class="answer">
Love to watch boxing and MMA. 
</p>

<div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

   <p class="question">The city of Detroit just filed for bankruptcy, while the Detroit Redwings are getting a brand-new, 
    $440 million stadium. What, if anything, does this say about our society&#8217;s relationship to sports?</p>

<p class="answer">
Ridiculous. Classic Detroit. </p>   

<div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

<p class="question">Are chefs going the way of the sports player? Do you think we&#8217;ll get to a point where chefs become represented 
  by agents and sign year-long contracts to cook at the country&#8217;s top restaurants?

</p>

   <p class="answer">That exists already. How do you think I got the job at Porta?</p>   

   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

<p class="question">Would you ever be represented by Jerry Maguire? 
</p>

   <p class="answer">Sure.
</p>   

<div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

<p class="question">Most underrated Tom Cruise movie.
</p>

   <p class="answer">I think you either just watched <i>Top Gun</i> or possibly have a crush on Tom Cruise.
</p>   

<div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

<p class="question">If I had to create a Tom Cruise movie themed food product, it would be Vanilla Sky Chai. Sold at the finest Starbucks
 establishments. What would yours be? 
</p>

   <p class="answer">Whiskey Business and you definitely have a Tom Cruise crush.
</p>   

<div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

<p class="question">Scientology isn&#8217;t that crazy, is it?</p>

   <p class="answer">I was told to never discuss religion or politics. Someone, mainly Tom Cruise, is going to get offended, which in turn would offend you.
</p>

   <div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

   <p class="question">Is food the new religion?
</p>

   <p class="answer">It&#8217;s my religion. Think about this, Jesus turned water into wine and loaves into fish. That&#8217;s just some advanced molecular gastronomy. I also 
    believe that by taking food seriously, caring about the product, we are making the world better and cleaner.  The slow food movement is a &#8220;religion.&#8221;  
    Reconnecting with the earth, protecting our ecosystem, preserving our culture through tradition, making food taste better.  
</p>   

<div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

<p class="question">Another food product idea. The Ten Command-mints. Cleanse your breath and your soul! Your thoughts. 
</p>

   <p class="answer">1st Ammend-mints. Cleanse your breathe and your right to free speech. Sacra-mints. From halitosis to hallelujahs. Engage-mints. 
    Shit or get off the pot and eat a mint. I&#8217;ll go all day...
</p>   

<div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

<p class="question">I never drank the wine at church. Could you recommend something for me to drink now that would give me a similar holy experience?
</p>

   <p class="answer">I drink brown booze. Love whiskeys. A friend brought a bottle of scotch over one day. Some guy was getting rid of it, 
    Chivas Regal Royal Salute 21yr.  Fancy stuff and absolutely perfect.

</p>   

<div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

<p class="question">Is Porta a holy experience? Do you think a restaurant can be a door to world peace?
</p>

   <p class="answer">I think a restaurant is a place to eat, drink, talk, and laugh.  It brings people together. We are connected through the food 
    and the table.  Porta does this so well because it imitates our home around the holidays or a BBQ. Plates of delicious food down the length of the 
    table, games in the backyard, beer, wine.  
</p>   

<div><img src="images/hr_interviews2.png" alt="" width="685px" /></div>

<p class="question">Thanks for your time, Killabreeze. See you on Instagram. 
</p>

   <p class="answer">Ok Mark, anytime, but call me Chris. See ya.</p>
