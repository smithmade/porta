The inner flame of the beast is capable of willing only one thing; heat. To work within
this single-minded force requires a certain sacrifice of one’s own multiplied will - a
humble recognition of the essence of the object and an understanding of how the
object contains the force of fire.
The oven produces an incredible heat, spiraling, contained, it is incapable of reaching
an end, always in the middle, always open, conjuring a presence, maintaining
movement, sound, and then moments of quiet, near silence, rest, refrain, and the
return. To return to the oven is to reignite the flame, to awaken the beast, to once
again greet the eagle and allow the liver to be eaten; to return to the oven
 is to return
the object to its essential state of being.
<img src="images/essay5/clocks.png" alt="Clocks" class="clocks" />
<p>To work on the oven is to
maintain its essence. One
must maintain the oven
within a certain limit, always
dancing around a line and
never crossing. It is a
balancing act, a tightrope
walk, to allow the oven to
serve its purpose. The will of
the oven is to contain the
fire. The will of the cook is
to produce food.  
<img src="images/essay5/rate.png" alt="Rate" class="rate" />
</p>
<p class="one_must">One must process time at a rate that is not human. The oven is a living, breathing
organism, keeping a pace different than human speeds. It is a beast, it is a bull. It
snorts and it kicks and it can run for hours without rest. The soul of the beast exists
somewhere between the tension of two wills – the oven’s and the cook’s – it is in this
void that the beast reveals itself, speaking through fire.</p>
<p>
The oven swirls ashy fish born out of fire, swirls them round the window to sync itself to the perceptions of the cook, this is the oven recognizing you, conjuring a
presence to comprehend, to recognize, to serve, to disappear or be forgotten in a cloud
of smoke, consumed once again by fire.</p>
<img src="images/essay5/briefs.png" alt="Briefs" class="briefs" />
<p>
What comes out of the oven is essential. To eat, drink, engage in what is essential. The
oven gives food. Food supplies life. All else is vanity.</p>
<p>
The oven exists before consciousness, in a pure state. It has a single will, and that is to
will what is Good. Burns, destructions, deformations, are the broken
<img src="images/essay5/blind_compassion.png" alt="Blind Compassion" class="blind_compassion" />
 focus of an oven
cook, what it is to be human. To work the oven
is to sustain concentration, engage with silence,
watch the flame, open communication with the
object, give up one’s own thoughts.</p>
<p>
What the oven produces is a positive made
from two negatives. The pizza becomes the
replacement of two wills. Minus one raised to
the second power.</p>
<p>The product is the sacrifice made by both the oven and the cook. If it is pure, the cook
must become as blind as the oven, to produce equally and without hesitation, the same
for all, lacking judgment, containing heat. Blind compassion for the eater and all others.</p>
<p>But human choice is mandatory, and inevitable. The ability to make a decision while
working – when to spin, when to take, when to give. To cook on the oven is to exercise
the precision of decision-making, taking control of what choices one makes. The oven
gives so that one may take from it. To take is to make a choice. To make choices is to
cook, and become artisan. In this way one must always remain human, in order to
work upon what is not. The human is the artisan, while the oven is the object.
<strong>Between these two is the soul that is&nbsp;fire.</strong></p>
