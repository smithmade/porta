          A native of Spring Lake Heights, Brahn graduated from The New <br>
          School with a degree in fiction writing and literature. Then she <br>
          started cooking. She’s all about sour Skittles, singing Christmas carols <br>
          in the kitchen and crime-oriented TV shows. She wishes she had a <br>
          seltzer/black coffee IV. We’ll see what we can do about that, Bean.

        <p class="contributor-bio">
          Born and raised on a dairy farm outside of Naples, Caporuscio first <br>
          developed his culinary skills producing and selling cheese. After <br>
          studying the craft of Neapolitan pizza, he came stateside – to <br>
          Pittsburgh of all places – and opened his first two successful pizzerias. <br>
          Currently, he lives and works in NYC, overseeing Kesté and Don <br>
          Antonio by Starita.

          A fan of heavy metal and modernist cuisine, Carter was trained in <br>
        the kitchens of Sirena and Maialino before making his home with us. <br>
        You’ll always find him with a fresh haircut hidden underneath a new <br>
        ball cap. And we're still not sure exactly how many tattoos he has, or <br>
        why everyone calls him Bud. Some things are better left mysteries.

        <p class="contributor-bio">
          A native of Spring Lake Heights, Crossman studied comparative <br>
          literature in college, writing her senior thesis on Dante’s La Vita <br>
          Nuova in relation to medieval monastic scribal practice and Freudian <br>
          memory theory. She admits it was “very weird.” That’s why we love <br>
          her. Currently, she is the executive chef of Pascal &amp; Sabine, and an <br>
          integral member of Smith’s executive culinary team.

        <p class="contributor-bio">
          Born in Eastern Europe, Ferbei’s family owned a farm where they <br>
          always used to cook fresh, delicious food. Perhaps that’s why he got <br>
          into cooking. A man who’s heart is on the water (he was a shipbuilder <br>
          in a former life and loves to fish on his days off), you can also find <br>
          him tending to his vegetable garden during the growing season.

          Hinchliffe grew up in Rhode Island, the only child of an English <br>

          “I love photographing strangers. The most difficult part of <br>

          A staunch advocate of handshakes, ketchup, and Pomeranians <br>
          named Gus, you can usually find Holzheimer in the kitchen wearing <br>

          MJ studied filmmaking for two years at SVA before earning an <br>
          English degree from Rutgers. For a little over a year he worked on <br>

          and the ever so intimate small talk. In 2012, MJ finally decided to <br>
          leave to focus on reading, writing and painting.
